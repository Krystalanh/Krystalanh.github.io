### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 
    Lab 4 part 1 was my favorite because it taught me how to convert millimeters to teaspoons, to tablespoons, to ounces, and then to cups. Despite it sounding simple with given instructions, I got to learn how to use the input and print out the output with the usage of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This lab was hard when I first looked into the instructions but also the lab I gained most knowledge.

* Lab 5 
    Lab 5 part 1 was my favorite because I got to learn how to use arguments in a proper way to print out arguments for sandwiches in this specific lab. I was about to imply into the code for the output to read 3 arguments and if not, would let the user know to supply them. This lab overall was not too complicated, it was just frustration at first and then once my partner and I were able to solve the problem, we felt relief and gained knowledge.

* Lab 8
    Lab 8 part 1 is one of my favorites because we got to understand the concept of patterns using loops. This lab was interesting as we got an understanding of which types of loops fit best for users to get a specific print pattern. This lab was overall fun and easy, fixing small details and getting the right output was super exciting to see.
