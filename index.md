### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 
    Lab 4 part 1 was my favorite because it taught me how to convert millimeters to teaspoons, to tablespoons, to ounces, and then to cups. Despite it sounding simple with given instructions, I got to learn how to use the input and print out the output with the usage of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This lab was hard when I first looked into the instructions but also the lab I gained most knowledge.
